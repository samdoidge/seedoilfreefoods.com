<p>In essence it seems to be the key component in the modern western diet that has us experience massive increases in obesity and diabetes etc vs 150 years ago. These polyunsaturated fatty oils do have a perceived positive impact on cholesterol levels, but in studies mentioned in the second video below, actual mortality increases with the use of them. We have seen carbohydrate consumption decrease in recent years, but obesity levels are not going down.</p>

<p>There is much more to add on this, and resources from Dr Catherine Shanahan, Tucker Goodrich, Dr. Paul Saladino. etc. For now I will include a couple of videos that helped me. This is intended to be a living page and welcome input from others.</p>
